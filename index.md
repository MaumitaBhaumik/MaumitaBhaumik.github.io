*(Zandvoort beach, December, 2022)*

I am a PhD student in the department of Linguistics at the [English and Foreign Languages University](http://www.efluniversity.ac.in/), Hyderabad, India. Earlier, I was a Masters student in Linguistics at [Jawaharlal Nehru University](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/), New Delhi. 

My passion for Linguistics began when I discovered the field during my undergraduate years while I was studying the English language. Since then, I have explored the different sub-areas of Linguistics. Recently, however, I have found my interest in the Psychology of Language, and have decided to make this my future research pursuit. 

Among the numerous areas of the psychology of language, I am particularly interested in understanding how we communicate meaning in social life. I am curious to know in depth about the relation between language and general human cognition, and about how these faculties aid each other in their development. While exploring the area of pragmatic acquisition, I also came across some fascinating concepts, such as the Theory-Theory of theory of mind, the concept of belief revision formulated by the Rational Constructivists, and the Relevance Theory of communication. These concepts brought me closer to the world of human reasoning and social cognition. And I am curious to explore them more in the light of language. 

I have experience working with preschool children and adults. So far, I have worked only using behavioral experiments. However, I am keen on learning using other techniques, such as brain imaging. 

This website is new, and I am still building it. The above is a gist of my current interests. You can also view my CV in the CV section above. 

I hope you will be able to view a better version of this website very soon!
