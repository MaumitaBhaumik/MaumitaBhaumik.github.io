*(Zandvoort beach, December, 2022)*

I am a PhD student in the department of Linguistics at the [English and Foreign Languages University](http://www.efluniversity.ac.in/), Hyderabad, India. Earlier, I was a Masters student in Linguistics at the [Jawaharlal Nehru University](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/), New Delhi. 

My passion for Linguistics began when I discovered the field during my undergraduate years while I was studying the English language. Since then, I have explored the different sub-areas of Linguistics. Recently, however, I have found my interest in the Psychology of Language. I am particularly interested in understanding how we communicate meaning in social life. I am curious to know in depth about the relation between language and general human cognition, and about how these faculties aid each other in their development.  

I have experience working with preschool children and adults. So far, I have worked only using behavioral experiments. However, I am keen on learning using the more advanced techniques.  

This website is new, and I am still building it. You can view my CV in the CV section above. 

I hope you will be able to view a better version of this website very soon!
