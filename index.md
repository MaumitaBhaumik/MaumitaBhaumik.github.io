I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics and Contemporary English at the [English and Foreign Languages University](http://www.efluniversity.ac.in/), Hyderabad, India. For my dissertation, I am advised by [Prof Shruti Sircar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qYLLngoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr Utpal Lahiri](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xowc0GUAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dr Meena Debashish](https://www.efluniversity.ac.in/Dr.MeenaC.Debashish.php). In 2019, I completed my M.A. in Linguistics from the [Jawaharlal Nehru University](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/), New Delhi. 

My research focuses on children's acquisition of language with special attention to their meaning comprehension in verbal communication. However, my interest is not limited to studying children. I am equally intrigued by the faculty of meaning comprehension in grown adults. The intricate interplay between semantics and pragmatics in meaning decoding is fascinating to me! I study the comprehension of ubiquitous logical words, such as connectives (_and, or, if-then_) and quantifiers (_some, all, every_), and I use experimental methods to study their comprehension. 

I study logical expressions because they provide us with a window into the complex relationship between language and general human cognition. I seek to understand how these faculties aid each other in their development. Particularly the relation between pragmatic meaning comprehension and the human ability of theory of mind delights me very much. 

I generally work using behavioral experiments. However, I am keen on learning using the more advanced techniques.  

This website is new, and I am still building it. You can view my CV in the CV section above. I hope you will be able to see a better version of this website very soon!
