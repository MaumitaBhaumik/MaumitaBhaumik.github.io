I am a PhD student in the department of Linguistics at the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad, India. Before that I did my Masters in Linguistics from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India. 
My passion for Linguistics started while I was doing my BA in English from the EFL University. Since then, I have explored various areas of Linguistics and currently have reached a point where I am utterly curious to know about the ineterface of language with the general cogntiion, and how they mututally aid each other in their development.
