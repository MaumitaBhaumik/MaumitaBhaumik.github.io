*(Zandvoort beach, December, 2022)*

I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics and Contemporary English at the [English and Foreign Languages University](http://www.efluniversity.ac.in/), Hyderabad, India. Earlier, I was an M.A. student in Linguistics at the [Jawaharlal Nehru University](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/), New Delhi. 

My passion for Linguistics began when I discovered the field during my undergraduate education in the English language. I am interested in almost everything about language. However, the study of the Psychology of Language intrigues me the most. I am particularly interested in understanding how we interpret meaning in conversation. The intricate interplay between semantics and pragmatics in meaning decoding is fascinating! I study the comprehension of ubiquitous logical words, such as connectives and quantifiers, in both children and adults. 

I am also curious to know in depth about the relation between language and general human cognition, and about how these faculties aid each other in their development. Particularly the relation between pragmatic meaning comprehension and the human ability of theory of mind fascinates me.

I generally work using behavioral experiments. However, I am keen on learning using the more advanced techniques.  

This website is new, and I am still building it. You can view my CV in the CV section above. I hope you will be able to see a better version of this website very soon!
