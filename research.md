<h3> <span style="color: #3498DB ;">Children's derivation of implicature involving disjunction (or)</span> </h3> 

For my _Ph.D._ _dissertation_, I am looking into Bengali children's comprehension of the disjunction word _or_. My work is informed by the current literature on children's pragmatic acquisition - especially their acquisition of the scalar implicature. My research question is whether children can derive scalar implicature from disjunctive sentences if they are well-supported by contextual information. To answer the question, I have heavily relied on the current literature on the intersection of disjunction and scalar implicature, and have also undertaken knowledge from the work done on the Theory of Mind. My work is influenced by the ideas of the Relevance Theory (Sperber & Wilson, 1986/1995).
