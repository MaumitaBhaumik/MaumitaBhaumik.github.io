<h2> <span style="color: #3498DB ;">Children's comprehension of disjunction </span> </h2> 

For my _Ph.D._ _dissertation_, I am looking into Bengali children's comprehension of the disjunction word _or_. My work is informed by the current literature on children's pragmatic acquisition, especially the acquisition of the scalar implicature, and is influenced by the ideas of the Relevance Theory (Sperber & Wilson, 1986/1995). My research question is whether preschool children can derive scalar implicature from disjunctive sentences if they are well-supported by contextual information. To answer the question, I am using experimental techniques (mostly behavioral) which are geared toward bringing maximum relevance to the children in the studies. My work also incorporates knowledge from the research done on the Theory of Mind.  Below, I have added a list of references to give you a preliminary idea about the nature and scope of my work:

<h2> <span style="color: #3498DB ;">Processing scalar implicature </span> </h2> 
In this project, I am exploring implicature processing in adults. My interest is to figure out whether implicature derivation is cognitively costly. I hypothesize that the effort for processing scalar implicature is the same as the computation of the logical meaning. It is because every meaning - be it lower-bounded (logical) or upper-bounded (implicature) - is not removed from context, and contextual information is not necessarily actively sought by a listener; rather it is given as a cognitive environment. Please have a look at the following list to get an idea of the scope of the research.

<h2> <span style="color: #3498DB ;">Disjunction expressions in Indian languages: Usage of conditional morphemes </span> </h2>
This project aims to capture the nature of disjunction words used in the languages of the Indian sub-continent. Indian languages like Hindi or Bengali use more than one expression to refer to disjunction in sentences. For example, Hindi uses '_yā_' and '_nahito_'; Bengali uses '_bā_ ' and '_noyto_' to refer to disjunction. Interestingly, words like '_nahito_' and '_noyto_' are bi-morphemic which can be split into an 'if not' construction. This phenomenon is not noticed in languages such as English, Japanese, Mandarin, or French for instance. Such bi-morphemic disjunction expressions are seen in other Indian languages too. Such as Meitei, a north-east Indian language, uses the word '_natraga_' or '_natradi_' to refer to disjunction which too have the 'if-not' meaning. For example, '_natra_' means 'not' and '_ga_' is a conditional bound morpheme. 

I aim to investigate why there is more than one expression for disjunction in these languages, which is not very common in other languages, and how these expressions are used in these languages - especially what significance the 'if-not' construction holds in these languages. My greater objective is to see how the information can feed/counter the existing theories about the human language faculty.
